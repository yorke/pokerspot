Pokerspot was a commercial online real-money gaming site launched in 2000.  7 years later, we're opensourcing our software with pure intent to lower the barrier to entry to the current market, hopefully introducing more competition to a fairly monopolized industry, thus putting the power back in the hands of the people.  This software should be used for fun, play-money games, or commercially.  Do with it as you see fit.  Perhaps a community will evolve around it, and we can effect positive societal change through new technologies (or at least 'rake free' poker).
