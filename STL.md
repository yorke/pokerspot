When the poker code was developed in 1999/2000, Visual Studio 6.0 had some real implementation problems with C++ STL (Standard Template Library).  This made it necessary to use a 3rd party implementation of the STL.  Using the latest developer's tools from Microsoft makes this unnecessary, and the STL littered throughout the codebase should be migrated out.
